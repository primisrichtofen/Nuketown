Agglomerative Clustering Algorithm:

Theory:
Agglomerative Clustering is a bottom-up approach to hierarchical clustering. It starts by treating each data point as its own cluster and then iteratively merges the closest clusters until only one cluster remains or a stopping criterion is reached. The closeness of clusters is typically determined using a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance.

Algorithm:
1. Input: 
    Dataset with data points.
2. Initialize:
    Each data point starts as its own cluster.
3. Calculate Pairwise Distances: 
    Compute the distance between each pair of clusters.
4. Merge Closest Clusters: 
    Merge the two closest clusters into one.
5. Repeat: 
    Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the desired number of clusters is reached or all points are merged into one cluster.
6. Output: 
    The final cluster assignments.

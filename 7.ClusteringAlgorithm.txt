Clustering Algorithm

Theory:
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group data points into clusters based on similarity. Weka provides several clustering algorithms like k-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and EM (Expectation-Maximization). These algorithms partition the data into groups where points in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

Algorithm:
1. Input: 
    Dataset with  data points and desired number of clusters 
2. Initialize: 
    Randomly select initial centroids.
3. Assign Points: 
   Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on distance.
4. Update Centroids: 
    Calculate new centroids as the mean of all points in each cluster.
5. Repeat: 
    Reassign points and update centroids until centroids stabilize or maximum iterations are reached.
6. Output: 
    Final cluster assignments and centroids.

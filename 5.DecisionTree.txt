Decision Tree Classifier:

Theory: 
A Decision Tree is a model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences. It splits the data into subsets based on the feature values, and the process continues recursively until a stopping criterion is met. It’s widely used in classification tasks due to its simplicity and interpretability.

Algorithm:
1. Load the dataset into WEKA.
2. Preprocess the data (optional) for cleaning and transformation.
3. Select the Decision Tree classifier:
	 Go to Classify → Trees → J48.
4. Configure parameters (optional).
5. Train the model by clicking Start.
6. Evaluate the model using the output metrics.

How to Do:
Classify Tab → Trees → J48

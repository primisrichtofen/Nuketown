Experiment 3: Handling Missing Data and Attribute Selection

(i) Handling Missing Data

Theory:
Handling missing values can be done by replacing missing data or removing instances/attributes with missing values.

Algorithm:

1. Load the dataset.
2. Identify missing values.
3. Choose a method to handle them (imputation or removal).
4. Apply the method.

How to do:
Go to Preprocess → Filter → Choose filters → Unsupervised → Attribute → NumericCleaner.

(ii) Attribute Selection

Theory:
Attribute selection reduces the number of irrelevant or redundant features in a dataset, improving model performance and efficiency.

Algorithm:

1. Load the dataset.
2. Choose an attribute evaluator (e.g., InfoGain, CfsSubsetEval).
3. Choose a search method (e.g., BestFirst, GeneticSearch).
4. Apply the selection to get the relevant attributes.

How to do:
Go to Preprocess → Filters → Supervised → Attribute → AttributeSelection.

Association Mining FPM
Theory:

Association rule mining is a technique used to find interesting relationships, patterns, or associations among a set of items in large datasets. The Frequent Pattern Mining (FPM) algorithm identifies the most frequent itemsets in a dataset and uses these itemsets to generate association rules. Weka provides several tools to implement these algorithms, such as the Apriori algorithm for finding frequent itemsets and generating association rules.

Algorithm:

1. Generate Candidate Itemsets: 
   Start with individual items (size 1).
2. Count Support: 
   Count the frequency of each itemset.
3. Prune Infrequent Itemsets: 
   Remove itemsets below the minimum support threshold.
4. Generate Larger Itemsets: 
   Combine frequent itemsets to create larger ones.
5. Repeat: 
   Continue until no larger frequent itemsets are found.
6. Generate Rules: 
   Create association rules from frequent itemsets based on confidence.

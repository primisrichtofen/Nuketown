Association Rule Mining:

Theory:
Association Rule Mining identifies relationships between items in a dataset. It involves:
1. Frequent Itemset Generation: 
    Find itemsets meeting a minimum support threshold.
2. Rule Generation: 
    Create rules from frequent itemsets that meet a minimum confidence threshold.

Algorrithm:
1. Input: 
    Dataset of transactions, minimum support, and minimum confidence.
2. Generate Candidate Itemsets: 
    Start with single items and progressively form larger itemsets.
3. Count Support: 
    Calculate the frequency of each itemset.
4. Prune Infrequent Itemsets: 
    Eliminate itemsets below the minimum support threshold.
5. Generate Association Rules: 
    Create rules from frequent itemsets and calculate confidence.
6. Output: 
    Association rules that meet the minimum support and confidence criteria.
